# Frontend-project-twogood

```
This project is like a simplified version of the TwoGood website. It's built using basic front-end tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But, it's not just basic â€” it also has cool features like smooth scrolling, animations, and effects that happen when you scroll. It's all about making the user experience more interesting!
